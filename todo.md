# todo:
- [ ] #1   (feat) add position parser
- [ ] #2   (feat) add move parser (requires #1)
- [x] #3   (feat) add game state check functions
- [x] #4   (test) update the tests to check for game states
- [ ] #5   (feat) game state from the previous position can be cached
- [ ] #6   (feat) available moves from the previous position can be cached
- [ ] #7   (feat) implement a very simplified evaluation function where the pieces are scored according to their distance to the center
- [ ] #8   (feat) implement the simplest kind of ai, where the ai uses the minmax algorithm to find an "optimal" move
- [ ] #9   (feat) implement alpha-beta pruning
- [ ] #10  (test) add info messages about the test commands
- [ ] #11  (test) implement better command system that allows subcommands like 'test', 'load-fen' etc.
- [ ] #12  (test) depth tests do not create random moves as the test takes not more than few milliseconds, so the seed for the srand function is almost always the same
- [ ] #13  (feat) add all of the remaining parts of the fen loader
- [ ] #14  (feat) add fen saver
- [ ] #15  (feat) implement `DRAW_BY_REPETITION` and `DRAW_BY_NO_MOVES`
